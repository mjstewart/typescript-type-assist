This intention removes the placeholder property value inserted by the code generation tool.

<p>If the placeholder is a string, the new value is a set of string quotes based on the 'string style' set in
    the Typescript Type Assist settings. All non string types result in the placeholder value being deleted ready for the new value.</p>
